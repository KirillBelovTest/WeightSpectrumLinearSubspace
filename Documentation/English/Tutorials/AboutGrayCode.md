# About Gray Code

The reflected binary code (RBC), also known as Gray code after Frank Gray,  
is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one  
bit (binary digit). The reflected binary code was originally designed to  
prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches. Today, Gray codes  
are widely used to facilitate error correction in digital communications  
such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems.
